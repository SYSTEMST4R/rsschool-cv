At the moment I am working as an engineer in mechanical engineering. My job is interesting, but not very profitable. My desire to learn the code, how this or that program works, how the element on the site is made has accompanied me since childhood. At the moment I’m just learning, I took a course on website development, mastered Css and HTML, created a couple of sites and I’m not going to stop there. I am a fairly diligent student and have a habit of sorting out the questions I have. If I don’t know how to do something, but I need it, then I will definitely figure it out.

I have no work experience yet, but I really want to try to make something to order. Let it be free work, I need experience

Secondary technical education + higher technical education. I’m taking courses right now

My level of English is “I didn’t get lost in Germany on vacation”. And this is not a joke, I have problems with grammar, but I have spoken English. I understand that knowledge of English is very important, but at this stage they are very modest for me
